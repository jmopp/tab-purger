# Tab Purger
A Firefox extention to close multiple tabs at once

This extension shows your open tabs, grouped by domain. Close all the tabs in a given domain, or expand the domain and close individual tabs.

Tabs can be closed either by middle-clicking or clicking the 'close' button to the right. Clicking on a tab title takes you to that tab.
